# Hopes and Dreams

Hopes and Dreams is a social platform designed to help users collaborate, share and plan their hopes, aspirations, dreams and goals.  The site is designed as a collaborative space through which, with a little luck and a little help, those dreams might come true.

## UX - Strategy 
([back to top](#contents))

### 1) Research

My research ahead of this project has involved looking at existing social platforms and analyzing what makes them work (or otherwise) and interviewing friends, colleagues and family to understand what they do and don't like about them.  I am also lucky to be able to draw on 20 years of experience working in online advertising and marketing.  On reviewing the information I have been able to gather, I have settled on a number of key points which, through the establishment of developer goals and user stories, will be important in a social platform as intimate as this.

### 2) Project Goal

Hopes and Dreams intends to be a place to realise positive aspirations. I intend to avoid the sort of language that exists around setting goals.  Whilst planning tools can be part of the process (either as part of the MVP or part of the evolution of the project) this is about blue skies thinking. The intention is that a community will develop to support people in pursuit of their dreams, at which point they could become goals, rather than interaction with the site be a goal-setting exercise in itself.  The aspiration is almost as important as the realisation, as such creating and sharing a dream with the community will be intended as a journey of discovery rather than a chore.  Dreams are meant to be shared almost as much as they are meant to be realised.

The main goal of the project then, is to develop this community and bring people together, through a UI which makes the site a pleasure to use.  It's about having people put their dreams and ideas in writing and find like-minded people.  On a simple MVP level this will simply be about matching dreams to users, creating a 'feed of dreams' containing a variety of fascinating hopes and aspirations, hopefully some of which will motivate the user to positively engage - whether this engagement means offering advice, the benefit of experience or even practical assistance.  The site will also act as a more conventional social platform, where you can actively search for and follow individuals or their aspirations and receive updates about how things are going for them.

### 3) Developer Goals

- Build portfolio: I want this project to display originality which will make it stand out from the crowd and provide value for users.
- Develop technical skills:  I would like to make use of JQuery on this occasion to simplify the Javascript, along with more advanced CSS techniques to create a feast for the eyes.  The way the database is indexed will be very important and I think I will learn a lot duriung this project, probably the hard way!
- Extensibility: Using Mongo DB as a DBMS combined with a modular plan for the design means there is huge scope for future development and monetisation.

### 4) Site Owner - User Stories

Based on my project research I have identified the following key areas.

- Brand Identity: The branding needs to be strong and clear from page one
- Site purpose:  The site mission and purpose needs to be clearly stated to encourage sign-up.  It needs to inspire people.
- Simple sign-up: I want as much site interaction as possible as quickly as possible and users need a simple sign-up process just as soon as they hit the homepage.
- Clean UI: I want the UI to be a stripped down and simple as possible so that it functions as well on mobile as it does on desktop, and looks great on both.  I want it to look so great people can't wait to click or tap on things.
- Clear User Journey:  From the minute the user clicks the sign-up button, they need to be hand-held through the process.  This is a new concept and signing up is the most important part of that journey.  As soon as they have signed up and land in the site for the first time, the question 'what do I do now' needs to be answered.
- Organic feed:  No edge weighting, all content has an equal chance on the general feed. No compulsary marketing on any feed. Logic for displaying dreams must be clean and effective.

### 5) Site Visitor - User Stories

This site should be for everyone, from any walk of life.  As such the user stories focus on UI, engagement and provision of compelling content.

- Reasons to stay:  The homepage needs to give users instant motivation to sign up, through brand imagery and a clear concept.
- Clean user journey:  The user journey needs to be interesting, but not too long, particularly through the sign-up phase.
- Quick and intuitive UI: to avoid drop-outs the user should not be hunting for anything.
- Customisable look and feel: People like to be able to make their corner of the web their own.  
- Access to content: Feeds need to reflect what people are following and the things they have interest in, and searches need to deliver relevant results.
- Safe Space:  Users need to feel their data is safe, that any data they provide is provided for a good reason, and that they have control over comments and content they see.
